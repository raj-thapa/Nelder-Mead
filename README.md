# Nelder-Mead
#This repository provides an implementation of the Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm in Python. The Nelder-Mead algorithm is a simplex-based optimization method for finding the minimum or maximum of an objective function. It works by iteratively updating the vertices of a simplex (a set of d+1 points in d-dimensional space) to converge to the optimal solution.
